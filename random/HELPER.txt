2. Use fail-fast techniques. fail fast means tha building code so 
that bugs are generated more often, on event of failure. Rather than 
not throwing an exception, whenever a small error occurs, throw an 
exception, so bugs can be identified and corrected instantly.
Assertions are the key t 'xAd' o failing fast. 

3. However, itâ€™s tough to know when to
add assertions. One way to tell is to look for comments. Comments often 
document assumptions about how a piece of
code works or how it should be called.
When you see those comments, or feel
like writing one, think about how you
can turn it into an assertion instead.

4. Stacks 
precond 	: top = -1, 
isEmpty() 	: top ==-1, 
isFull()	: top == n-1

5. Queue:
precond : head,tail = -1,
